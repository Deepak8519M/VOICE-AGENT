Hooks in React

VIRTUAL CODE Hooks In react
-Hooks allows function components to have access to state  and other 
React features . Because of this , class components are generally no 
longer needed.
-Now what is state in React?
-In React , State is a javascript object that holds data and information 
about a component.
VIRTUAL CODE Hooks In react
-There are so many Types of Hooks in React -
1. useState( ) Hook
2. useEffect( ) Hook
3. useRef( ) Hook
4. useMemo( ) Hook
5. useCallback( ) Hook
6. useContext( ) Hook
7. useReducer( ) Hook
8. useLayoutEffect( ) Hook
9. customHook( ) Hook
VIRTUAL CODE Hooks In react
1.useState( ) Hook -
The react ,useState Hook allows us to track state in a function 
component.
State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in 
an application.
We initialize our state by calling useState in our function component
useState accepts an initial state and returns two values .
1. Current state
2. A function that updates the state

VIRTUAL CODE Hooks In react
2. useEffect( ) Hook -
 
The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your 
components.
Some examples of side effects are – 
1. Fetching data
2. Directly updating DOM Element
3. Timers
useEffect accepts two arguments . The second argument is optional

VIRTUAL CODE Hooks In react
2. useEffect( ) Hook -
When No dependency passed -
When An Empty array passed -

VIRTUAL CODE Hooks In react
2. useEffect( ) Hook -
When state values  or props passed -

VIRTUAL CODE Hooks In react
3. useRef( ) Hook -
The useRef hook allows you to persist values between renders
It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re -render 
when updated.
It can be used to access a DOM element directly
useRef( ) only returns one item . It returns an object called current.
When we initialize useRef we set the initial value useRef( 0 )

Context API

VIRTUAL CODE Context
  
AP
I
-Context API in React is used to share data across the components 
without passing the props manually through every level.
-Context API is used to pass global variables anywhere in the code 
without the prop drilling
-It helps when there  is a need for Sharing state between a lot of 
nested components.
-It is light in weight and easier to use, to create a context just need to 
call React.createContext() .
-No need to install other dependencies or third -party libraries like 
Redux for state management.

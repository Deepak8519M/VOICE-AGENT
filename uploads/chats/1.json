Could you tell me what topics were covered in that unit?  For example, did it cover specific cloud models (like IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), security aspects, deployment models, or something else?  The more detail you give me, the better summary I can create for you.\n"

    "ai_response": "Subject: Cloud Computing Unit 2 Summary\n\nHey there!\n\nHere's a quick summary of Unit 2 on Cloud Computing:  It mainly covers virtual machines (VMs) and how they're used to virtualize clusters and data centers.\n\nThe unit explains that virtualization lets you run multiple VMs on a single physical machine, improving resource sharing and performance.  It achieves this by separating the hardware from the software.\n\nDifferent levels of virtualization are discussed, including: instruction set architecture (ISA) level, hardware level, operating system level, library support level, and application level.  A key component is the hypervisor (or VMM), a software layer that creates the abstraction for the VMs.\n\nThe unit also touches upon virtual clusters, resource management, and how virtualization helps automate data centers.\n\nLet me know if you'd like any more details!\n"
